"""Persistent session goals — the Ralph loop for Hermes.

A goal is a free-form objective that stays active across turns; after each turn an auxiliary-model
judge decides whether it is satisfied. The continuation prompt is a normal user message appended via
``run_conversation`` (no system-prompt mutation or toolset swap — prompt caching stays intact). Judge
failures are fail-OPEN (``continue``); the turn budget is the backstop.

    "``wait_on_pid`` (releases on exit only).\n"
