"""Regression tests for Windows desktop-update Unix timestamps.

PowerShell's ``Get-Date -UFormat %s`` is locale-sensitive. Under an ``es-ES``
culture it can produce a comma decimal separator, and parsing that string with
``InvariantCulture`` turns a ten-digit Unix timestamp plus fractional seconds
into a value too large for ``System.Int32``. The detached Windows updater must
use a locale-independent Unix timestamp API for both marker and result files.

The updater script is not executable on the Linux CI lane, so these tests lock
the source-level contract and reject the exact broken conversion.
